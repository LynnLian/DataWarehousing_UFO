\begin{abstract}
Based on the data resourse from kaggle.com and the data processing by CRISP-DM, a fact shows us that most people saw UFO as a light shape in US during Summer in 2011. 
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
We want to analyse the database ufo sightings from
the website kaggle.com. For this we want to figure out 
when and where the UFO show up mostly, how the UFO looks like. 
\subsection{Scenario} \label{subsec:scenario}
The data source has totally 11 columns which covers the discovering time, location, shapes, duration and so on. As our goal is to find out the shapes, country and the number of ufo sightings depending on daytime or nighttime, we need to creates a data warehouse contains at least the information of shapes, country, time category.

\subsection{Structure of the Paper} \label{subsec:struct}
The paper is structured as follows: in Section~\ref{sec:dataunderstanding} we present the availability of Open Data we use in this project.
Then, in Section~\ref{sec:concept} we describe what is our concern to model the original data to our expected data. Finally, we conclude our work in Section~\ref{sec:concl} with (XXXXXXXXXX placeholder --> to see if any section we want to add).
In Section ~\ref{sec:dataPreparation}, ~\ref{sec:modeling},~\ref{sec:Evaluation}, we will introduce how we process the data under CRISP-DM.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Open Data: UFO Sightings} \label{sec:dataunderstanding}
As part of the \emph{Data Understanding} phase for our data science project, we first look at the state
of the art concerning our problem. The material presented in this section is based on Kaggle \cite{kaggle}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Concept for Problem} \label{sec:concept}
During the \emph{Data Understanding} phase, we find out a problem that we don't directly have the data we need .Additionally, some entries has NULL values. Accordingly, we need to have our Data prepared before the Analysis.

\subsection{Data Profiling}\label{subsec:dataProfiling}
In the \emph{Data Profiling} step, we realize not all the column we would need. Accordingly, we will only keep columns of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item datetime
    \item city
    \item state
    \item country
    \item shape
    \item duration(second)
    \item date posted
\end{itemize}
Also, for the NULL values, we will fill a necessary value in difference columns:
\begin{itemize}
    \item city / state / country\\
    If there is NULL values in city or state but not country. We fill in the country in those two columns because we will mainly focous on the fact with country.If the ones with both state and country missin, we will try to look at the city name, find the country and manually map as much as possible. The rest without reasonable information were filled with "unknown".
    \item shape\\
    We will fill in "unknown" to replace the NULL values.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Tools}\label{subsec:tools}
The list of all tools we use in this project and the purpose:  
\begin{itemize}
    \item SQLiteManager\\
    Data Cleaning, ETL process, CDWH \& DM creation
    \item DBSchema\\
    Forward Engineering
    \item BIRT\\
    Analytics
    \item Python\\
    Data Cleaning
\end{itemize}
    
\subsection{DWH layout}\label{subsec:DWHLayout}
After the ELT process, we should have a DHW which looks like this:

\section{Data Preparation} \label{sec:dataPreparation}
This section deals with the implementation of the concept described in Section~\ref{sec:concept} following the \emph{Data Preparation}
phase of CRISP-DM. 

To solve the problem, we have steps as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item step 1 Extract \\
  Download the data from website then create a database to store all raw data.
  \item step 2 Filtering\\
  Fill in values by the rule that mention in \ref{subsec:dataProfiling}.
  \item step 3 Enrichment\\
  We would like to see some relationship between the sighn and season, daytime, country and so on.In other word, we need difference dimentional. So we will create "new" data by using alsorithms:
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Create new columns for the year, month, day, hour, daytime, season
      \item Column year, month, day,hour\\
      Abtract data from column datetime
      \item Column daytime\\
      From 6am to 6pm is defined as daytime. The rest is defined as nighttime
      \item Column season\\
      Compute by column month
  \end{itemize}
  
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Modeling} \label{sec:modeling}
This section is to analyze the data we have prepare from Section ~\ref{sec:dataPreparation}.

To analyze, we have steps as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item step 1\\
    Import Cleaning Data in DWH (see DWH Layout in ~\ref{subsec:DWHLayout})
    \item step 2\\
    For the performan and speed, we create four data marts for our goal (See Fig. \ref{fig:dm-cms}, \ref{fig:dm-css}, \ref{fig:dm-dcd}, \ref{fig:dm-scy})

        \caption{Data mart - city/month/shape}
        \label{fig:dm-cms}

        \caption{Data mart - shape/country/year}
        \label{fig:dm-scy}
    \end{figure}
        
    \item step 3
    Using BIRT, we generate reports and find the fact as following:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Number of sightings in North American is extremely higher than other country. The next of the continent we know is Europe.(See Fig.\ref{fig:continent})\\
            - Data mart - Shape/Country/Year\\
            - Data cube - continent
                
            \item Nearly all sightings shows up in US.(See Fig. \ref{fig:country})\\
            - Data mart - Shape/Country/Year\\
            - Data cube - contry
               
            \item The most Sightings are seen at 2011. We can see that it obviously increases from 1995 until 2011.(See Fig. \ref{fig:year} )\\
            - Data mart - Shape/Country/Year\\
            - Data cube - year
                
            \item The UFO is most seen at Summer. (See Fig. \ref{fig:sight-season})\\
            - Data set - data mart - Continent/Shape/Season\\
            - Data cube - season
                 
            \item Different UFO shapes are seen and the most is likes light.(See Fig. \ref{fig:shape})\\
            - Data set - data mart - Continent/Shape/Season\\
            - Data cube - shape
                
            \item In difference continents, the most seen shape is still light. (See Fig. \ref{fig:shape-continent})\\
            - Data set - data mart - Continent/Shape/Season\\
            - Data cube - shape,continent
                
            \item In each season, light shape is mostly seen. (See Fig. \ref{fig:shape-season})\\
            - Data set - data mart - Continent/shape/season\\
            - Data cube - season, shape

\section{Evaluation} \label{sec:Evaluation}
From the reports, we can find out the number of shapes, country and the number of ufo sightings depending on daytime or nighttime. Also the reports in difference dimention. So it reach the goal after evaluation.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:concl}
We have shown in this paper that how we process the data under CRISP-DM and it shows difference dimention of shape, continents, country, seasons.
